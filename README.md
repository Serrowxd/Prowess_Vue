# Prowess_Vue

Prowess Guild Website, in the flavor of VueJS

-- Happy Place Notes --

!! Mandatory !!

`npm run less` requires [less-watch-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less-watch-compiler) in order to run.

I'm still learning VueJS, so this is just going to be my way of learning VueJS while I build an iteration of the guild website.

**TODO**

- Implement Vue
- Initial Design
- Image Assets

--

The initial design I'm going for will be very single-page feeling initially. A general layout example will be

- Navigation (hidden by default)

- Homepage, possible particle effects that lace the background with

  Prowess

  US-Mal'Ganis

  Become Elevated

Or some other form of layout, where the bottom text is animated and changing on a timer.

The play for the news section will probably be similar to how we did it with the Ana site, just a big banner with 3 sub-news pannels and a "more news" button for the 4th pannel. Rotating on a cycle based on the news that is pushed, with new items being pushed in.

Tier bosses can be filtered into custom banners of each boss with their artwork, then a link to the kill page with our team photo.

I think it'll be a solid design. I've got it in my head, just have to work on it.
